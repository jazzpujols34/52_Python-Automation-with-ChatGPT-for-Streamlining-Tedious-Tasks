# Automation with ChatGPT

This project demonstrates how to leverage ChatGPT to automate various tedious tasks. The code examples included cover the following functionalities:

## 1. Plotting Linear Regression

Utilizing `matplotlib` and `sklearn`, the code provides a way to visualize a linear regression model by plotting data points and the regression line.

## 2. Sending WhatsApp Messages

With the help of the `pywhatkit` library, the code shows how to automate the process of sending WhatsApp messages to a specific phone number.

## 3. Writing Emails

Although not shown in the provided code snippets, the project also includes guidance on how to send emails programmatically using Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries.

## 4. Web Scraping

The project outlines a method to scrape data from websites using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`, specifically focusing on extracting book titles and prices from a sample website.
